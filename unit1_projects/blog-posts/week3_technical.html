  	<h2> Jiving Javascript </h2>
  	<h3> JS pros and cons</h3>

  	<p> There are many reasons why Javascript is popular in web development, as some even dare call it "the language of the web". While HTML can serve to give a website its structure and CSS its styling, it is javascript that transforms a static website into an application serving an interactive experience. Whether through regular javascript or through one of its many libraries such as jQuery, most website interactivity is javascript-based as it facilitates manipulation of the DOM and making Ajax calls.</p>
	<p>In addition to these benefits, just about every single browser supports javascript; and, while it is traditionally known as a front-end language, you can even run it as your server side language. Also, javascript can work with other languages as it is embeddable in java and c++ projects as well. Javascript can even provide offline functionality.</p>
	<p>Another considerable plus for javascript is the large community of developers that help others problem solve through sites such as stack overflow, in addition to  contributing to many javascript open source projects and libraries. </p>
	<p>Considering I am still a javascript white-belt, I had to research what some of the drawbacks are as I have yet to push the technology to its limits. Here are some of the javascript drawbacks I found:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript does not have multithreading.</li>
			<li>You can't access web pages hosted on a different domains using solely javascript (you can do this using HTML5 workarounds or with server side scrips using AJAX calls)</li>
			<li>Javascript can't access databases without a server side script.</li>
			<li>Because each browser interprets javacripst a little differently, your script can display different behavior on different web browsers.</li>
			<li>Some users exercise their option to disable JavaScript, leaving behind a broken web app.</li>
		</ul>
