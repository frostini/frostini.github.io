  	<h2> Training Thoughts</h2>
  	<h3> Thinking about time managent</h3>

  	<p> It's pretty nice to be able to sit down, as part of an assignment for DBC, and check in with myself to feel how my your journey is going so far, how my thinking may be a factor to to my success (or failure) with the program, evaluating strategies that can be useful in overcoming difficulties, and implementing an action plan to overcome these difficulties.</p>
	<p>I am writing this as of the third week of DevBootCamp; and, in retrospect, there have already been many breakthroughs AND breakdowns. As we continue to blaze through  the DBC work-warp, I'm also seeing how just about every breakdown also leads to breakthrough, if you just stay at it.</p>
	<p>There were times were I needed to GIT some fresh air because I was about to GIT a strokeâ€¦so much so that I ended up working remotely for most of the assignments in the beginning. It turned out that I had "git init" one too many repositories, which ended up provoking some pretty buggy behavior, along with a case of the DS.Store blues, and some files choosing to hide from being seen, added, or committed. But you know what, I can say I am no longer afraid of the command line and have actually begun to look forward to collaborating on larger projects through version control systems such as GIT.</p>
	<p>GIT wasn't even close to being the main perpetrator here though. Nope. It was me causing most of ma' woes; and, primarily in the form of limiting mental constructs.</p>
	<p>Here is the thought-loop that was most apparent and difficult to work with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I can't do everything.</li>
		<li>Sure you can, you're "Marlon".</li>
		<li>Add more to my plate.</li>
		<li>Now I have too much on my plate-STRESS</li>
		<li>Work like crazy</li>
		<li>Feel like I have room to breath</li>
		<li>Put more on my plate because I'm feeling optimistic</li>
		<li>Now I have too much on my plate, again-STRESS</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've feel as if I've identified two underlying causes reinforcing this loop:</p>

<p>-(REASON 1)My time estimation skills are HORRIBLE when it comes to projecting how long the assignment is going to take me and then consequently schedule the time to get it done. How can I estimate how long it is going to take me to accomplish something I have never done before?</p>

<p>-(REASON 2)I think I'm smarter, faster, more able than I truly am. Shucks. And therefore overcompensate by thinking I will accomplish things faster and understand things easier than I actually do.</p>

<p>Reason 1 + Reason 2 = TIMEBOMB</p>

<h5>Solution: Open Work Blocks</h5>

<p>I no longer try to estimate how long something is going to take and am trying to take my identity bias out of the equation entirely. How so?
I simply allocate a task to a pomodoro time block (25mins), enter it with an open mind, and just hammer away at it.  By actually working on the task, even if I can't finish it in that time block,  
 I garner a working understanding of the task at hand and am then better positioned to devise a follow-up work plan. Aside from being a more pragmatic approach than blind-guestimation, working with this structure allows me to be completely invested in the task during that time block. Plus, working in this way is proving very rewarding as I am becoming more productive AND enjoy the complete task submersion.</p>

<p>This also complements my thinking style, Abstract Sequential, as this approach helps to ground my "love of theory and abstract thought".</p>

  <artitle class= "blog-entry" id="jiving-javascript">

  	<h2> Jiving Javascript </h2>
  	<h3> JS pros and cons</h3>

  	<p> There are many reasons why Javascript is popular in web development, as some even dare call it "the language of the web". While HTML can serve to give a website its structure and CSS its styling, it is javascript that transforms a static website into an application serving an interactive experience. Whether through regular javascript or through one of its many libraries such as jQuery, most website interactivity is javascript-based as it facilitates manipulation of the DOM and making Ajax calls.</p>
	<p>In addition to these benefits, just about every single browser supports javascript; and, while it is traditionally known as a front-end language, you can even run it as your server side language. Also, javascript can work with other languages as it is embeddable in java and c++ projects as well. Javascript can even provide offline functionality.</p>
	<p>Another considerable plus for javascript is the large community of developers that help others problem solve through sites such as stack overflow, in addition to  contributing to many javascript open source projects and libraries. </p>
	<p>Considering I am still a javascript white-belt, I had to research what some of the drawbacks are as I have yet to push the technology to its limits. Here are some of the javascript drawbacks I found:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript does not have multithreading.</li>
			<li>You can't access web pages hosted on a different domains using solely javascript (you can do this using HTML5 workarounds or with server side scrips using AJAX calls)</li>
			<li>Javascript can't access databases without a server side script.</li>
			<li>Because each browser interprets javacripst a little differently, your script can display different behavior on different web browsers.</li>
			<li>Some users exercise their option to disable JavaScript, leaving behind a broken web app.</li>
		</ul>

  	<h2> Building Blocks </h2>
  	<h3> Disecting the CSS display property </h3>

  	<p> Legos. Fun cubes. Square stackers. They've even built a theme park out of them. A parent's best friend, in that they can keep a kid busy for hours, that doubles as a child's modular channel of creative expresion.</p>
  	<p>Web designers and developers are kind of like children, in that we have our legos as well. HTML elements are all rendered as boxes when seen through the web browser and they too "entertain" us when building websites.<p>

  	<h4> Block Banter</h4>
  		<p>In Lego terms, HTML helps give our creation structure by defining the kind of blocks that will be used. CSS dresses up those blocks by defining their size, color, and style attributes. <br> Let's review CSS's most used display properties to look into the different ways our blocks can be treated.</p>

	<h5>Display: inline; </h5>
		<p>An element that is given the inline display property renders our elements in a way that is true to its name-- in-line with its constituents--meaning, an inline element does not break into a new line.</p>
		<p>Default examples of in-line elements are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>span</li>
		<li>a</li>
		<li>strong</li>
		<li>em</li>
		</ul>
		<p>NOTE: Height and width can't be specified for inline elements.</p>


	<h5>Display: block;</h5>
		<p>An element that is given the block display property takes up the  entire width available, thereby forcing other elements to display in another line.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>div</li>
		<li>h1-h6</li>
		<li>p</li>
		<li>ul, ol, and li</li>
		</ul>

	<h5>Display:  inline-block;</h5>
		<p>An element that is given the inline-block display property is placed as an inline element (on the same line as its neighbors) AND behaves like a block element. This distinction allows us to set width and height, as well as margins and paddings.
		<br>
		Both inline and block elements can be given the inline-block display property.

<article class= "blog-entry" id="chrono-challenge">

<h2>Chrono-Challenge</h2>
<h3>Thinking in terms of Time</h3>

<p>My biggest time challenge so far has been starting phase0 without enough respect for the coursework itself. I went into it with an attitude of, "I'll just keep my regular workload, set aside about 10 hours on the side, and get the prep work done--no prob. Im certain I'll finish it a lot faster than most". The first week was a bucket of cold water when I realized this was not going to be the case. To a certain extent, this ended up provoking a heavier workload because as I started to withdraw a bit from my professional work, in order to work on the DBC material, and it seemed that more work issues kept coming up to demand more of my time due to my increased delegation. This ended up becoming a bit of a vicious circle where I would feel guilty for disconnecting from the business and would also feel guilty for not investing myself fully with DBC.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been trying to not think of either guilt scenario and simply move forward with the course material.</p>
<p>To do so, I've been going into each day with a game plan. I am administering three kinds of time blocks: (1) personal; (2) professional; and (3) programming (DBC).  I should probably change their order, as the programming time block is the one that takes up the most time.</p>
<p>I am currently utilizing the pomodoro method for both professional and programming time blocks. I plan my day the night prior to and commit to those time blocks. Also, I assign particular tasks for each time block and then use these tasks to instruct the deliverables for that respective pomodoro. I make adjustments as the day progresses in determining a job is done, rolling unfinished tasks into another pomodoro, or scheduling remaining work for another day.</p> 
<p>Considering the following week's curriculum is released on Sunday, I will review what needs to be accomplished for the ensuing  week on Sun and schedule time for it going into the week. While I have realized my time estimation skills aren't as good as I would like for them to be with regarding to these assignments, I'm beginning to allocate even more time than I would think an assignment is going to take me.</p>
<p>Ideally, this is the structure I want to administer every week:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(Mon-Fri) Production during the week.</li>
	<li>(Sat) Wrap things up and check completion of ALL assignments.</li>
	<li>(Sun) Review curriculum for the following week and schedule related tasks.</li>
</ul>

<!--=====================1.8 WIREFRAME ENTRY===================-->
<article class= "blog-entry" id="web-whims">

	<h2>Working Web Whims</h1>
	<h3>Wireframing DropBox</h2>
	<p>Essentially, the DropBox website has 6 sections and they are as follows:
		<br><br>
		(1) Main Page/Initial screen page
		<br>
		(2-5)  Information Sections
		<br>
		(6) Footer Section
	</p>
			<a href="http://imgur.com/GyDRX5A"><img id="wireframe-img" src="http://i.imgur.com/GyDRX5A.jpg" title="Hosted by imgur.com" />
				<style>#wireframe-img {
						display: block;
						width: 80%;
						height: 750px;
						margin: 0 auto;
						}
				</style>
			</a>

	<h5>Purpose.</h5>
		<p>The website's main purpose is to empower its visitors with the content needed to inform their decision to sign-up for dropbox. I'd dare to say that this website is landing page-inspired, with added access to company content in the footer. 
		</p>

	<h5>Section 1-Component</h5>
		<p>The Main Page section can be further broken down 4 components.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>(Top component) This component does not contain a navigation  menu, it is simply a download link in the top right corner.</li>
		<li>(Image-Left) It is an animation between three components, a computer, a tablet, and a cell phone. An image appears on the screen of the laptop and the same image is then pushed out to the other two instruments.</li>
		<li>(Content-Right) This section has the company icon at the top, their value proposition is centered and immediately follows that vertically (Your stuff, anywhere), followed by the main action button (sign-up), and is then concluded by a Sign-in link immediately below that.</li>
		<li>(Bottom Link Section) This link is a local link that simply scrolls the page down to the following content section.</li>
		</ul>
	<h5>Section 1-Purpose</h5>
		<p>The purpose of this section is to give the visitor enough information about the product to try to get them to sign-up immediately. Upon landing on the site, one can "see" what dropbox does in the first 5 seconds, thanks to the short animation/valueprop/icon, and the user can also click on the conveniently located Sign-Up button.
		</p>
	<h5>Sections 2-5: Components</h5>
		<p>Each one of these sections is essentially the same and can be broken down into two components.
		<ul>
		<li>(a) Picture. The picture illustrates what the content mentions</li>
		<li>(b) Content. The content is next to the image and is essentially a Title with a couple of sentences below it.
		These section are, "Wherever You Are", "Share with Confidence", "Safe and Secure", and "Drop Box for business", with a corresponding link top the dropbox for business page.</li>
		</ul>
	<h5>Section 2-5: Purpose</h5>
		<p>The purpose of these sections are to address any objections that the potential client might have, in case they weren't immediately convinced to sign-up for dropbox after seeing the initial section and wanted to "learn more" about the product. The objections are essentially doubts or questions that the potential client might have and that may become sign-up deterrents as a result of going unanswered or unaddressed. 
		</p>
	<h5>Section 6: Components</h5>
		<p>This section can be further broken down into two components, which are distributed vertically.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>(a) A Blue Sign up button and a white Download button of the same size.</li>
		<li>(b) Horizontally distributed links. 8 of them.</li>
		</ul>
	<h5>Section 6: Purpose</h5>
		<p> The purpose of this section is to allow those that have scrolled the entire page to sign-up or download the product. Furthermore, in case the person visiting the information is looking for other information (aside from downloading or enrolling) or is already a client, the links below the buttons can be clicked on to take you to their respective pages. This is very useful because this information is kept out of view for those that don't want to see and is made accessible for those that are looking for it.</p>
		<p>All in all, I believe the dropbox design team did an extraordinary job of managing their screen real estate by including only that which is vital, carrying a tasteful aesthetic, and distributing their content ideally for conversion.</p>

<!--=====================1.7 CRAZY COOKIN ENTRY===================-->

<article class= "blog-entry" id="crazy-cooking">


		<h2> Crazy Cooking</h2>
		<h3> Contemplating DevBootCamp Culture</h3>
		<p>Seeing <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef's Kitchen vs. Restaurant video</a> struck more than just a chord for me, it completely harmonized.</p>
<p>I'm getting through the content a bit late, as I had requested an extension for the first week, and so I'm seeing the video after most of my classmates and after reading some of their reflections. With this being said, I went into the video assuming that I already knew what the video was going to be about, I'd write a simple reflection, finish the assignment, and go onto the next oneâ€¦</p>
<p>It's kind of funny how my mentality going into the video was exactly the OPPOSITE of what Sherref would advise us to have, in kitchen vs. restaurant terms. So after checking myself, I thought how about cooking up some humble pie instead of ordering that italian, marlon !?</p>
<p>My interpretation of the DevBootCamp humble pie recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-Blown Mind</li>
<li>1-Open Heart</li>
<li>1-Willing Body</li>
<li>2-Cups of Childlike Innocence and zest for life</li>
<li>1-Cup Mad Scientist</li>>
<li>1-Cup Creative Artist</li>
</ul>
<p>Stir with discipline and in an IKE bowl (Integrity, Kindness, Effort)</p>
<p>Dish is best shared with others and with a cool glass of gratitude.</p>
<p>And just like any recipe, own it! ALL OF IT. Own the ingredients. Own the process. Own the taste. And excuse the messâ€¦so do clean up after yo' self and put them dishes back in place for others to use.</p> 

<p>Also, here are a few nuggets of wisdom that I gleaned from the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>We all have a ton to learn, a ton to offer, and a ton to learn in offering.</li>
<li>If want to go fast, go alone. If you want to get far, go together. WE ARE GOING FAR AND FAST.</li>
<li>This is a transformational right of passage.</li>
<li>Be mindful of when to go wide and when to go deep.</li>
<li>Be disciplined with your time.  Time Block.</li> 
<li>Be open to keep getting your mind blown</li>
<li>Kick your own arssssssssse</li>
<li>THIS IS ONE BIG EXPERIMENT</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's get cooking...Bon appetit !</p>

<!--=============1.6 CRAZY SYNOPSIZING SITES ENTRY===============-->


<article class= "blog-entry" id="synopsizing-sites">
<h2>Synopsizing Sites</h2>
<h3>Website Reviews</h3>


<p>
As a part of our Phase 0, Unit 1 exercises, we were given the task of choosing three of our favorite websites and giving them structured reviews. While the websites I use on a day-today are more consistent with the likes of dictionary.com, etymonline.com, wikipedia, facebook, pearltrees, and e-mail, I chose to review  AirBnB, DropBox, and Codepens for very particular reasons which will be explained in their respective reviews.</p>


    <h5>AirBnbn</h5>

<img class="review-image" src="airbnb.png" title="AirBnB"/>

			</a>
<p>Visual adjectives: clean, catchy, creative, simple, light</p>
<p>Content: well-structured, actionable by section, belo-based, practical, varied</p>

<p>I wanted to review the AirBnB primarily because of their recent rebrand, employing the belo as their new icon. Personally, I've used AirBnB to rent houses on numerous locations, both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>The website has a general user menu as a header, then haves the value proposition, and then gives you the option to begin exploring lodging options by choosing where/when/how many people. This is then followed by a banner, advertising the story of the new belo icon, and then a picture gallery of AirBnB main locations ensues. Following that, there is a screen-wide section for a video explaining the belo and then there are four columns with particular banners for each facet of their community module.</p>
<p>The website allows you to look for lodging without making a profile; however, it making a profile is a requirement if you would actually like to use airBnB to make a reservation. This incremental access is very important, I believe at least, because it serves those that just want to browse around to get an idea for lodging options (without much commitment) and it forces you to sign -up when making a reservation (making it more secure for both hosts/guests).  I feel this gives users the best of both worlds and is a clear insight to their target demographic. I feel the content is also structured in a very intuitive and accessible manner.</p>
 


<h5>DROPBOX</h5>
<img class="review-image" src="dropbox.png" title="DropBox"/>
<p>Visual adjectives: simple, fresh, open, inviting, innocent</p>
<p>Content adjectives: minimal, well-sequenced, purposeful, actionable, case-study worthy</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite websites because of the design itself. It isn't a website I use a lot and it's not even in my day-to-day workflow; however, I REALLY liked the design of this site since I first saw it. Particularly, the site invoked the feeling of great design, rather than the thought of itâ€¦.or in Marlon speak, it catalyzed my intuitive aesthetic inspectors.</p>
<p>The website helps instruct potential adopters of the product's offering by scrolling down. Furthermore, current customers can simply log-in from the initial same page, without being visually plagued.
The sketch and water color feel to the images is also on-pointâ€¦it gives it a soft charm and provokes a smile.</p>
<p>The only immediate actionable links on the home screen are Sign up, sign in, learn more, or download--all designated and distributed ideally. Value proposition is absolutely genius "your stuff, anywhere". The main page doesn't even include the company name, just the icon. Also, the images are dynamic and show how information is saved on a laptop and then is pushed into the other devices--splendid !</p>

<h5>CODEPEN</h5>
<img class="review-image" src="codepen.png" title="CodePen"/>
<p>visual adjective: dark, clean, modern, basic, cool</p>
<p>content adjectives: functional, accessible, clear, useful, essential</p>

<p>I REALLY wanted to review this website just in case other students haven't heard of code pens. This is an incredible way to share code online, in an interactive environment that enables you to actually see the code liveâ€¦within the same window! It splits your code into html, css, and javascript respectively. Also, CodePen curates the pens and showcase their display/code with website visitors. This is awesome because you can see how people employ tags differently and how so much can created with the same "basic" toolbox of html, css, and javascript.</p>
<p>This website has been really helpful to see what other people are cooking with html5 and css3. It seems that css generated graphics are all the new rage, with javascript interactivity being just as cool. 
The website allows you to make a profile and use pens for free; however, it sells PRO memberships that add functionality and gives you the option of making your pen's private.</P>
