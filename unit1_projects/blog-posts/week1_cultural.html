Seeing <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef's Kitchen vs. Restaurant video</a> struck more than just a chord for me, it completely harmonized.<br>
I'm getting through the content a bit late, as I had requested an extension for the first week, and so I'm seeing the video after most of my classmates and after reading some of their reflections. With this being said, I went into the video assuming that I already knew what the video was going to be about, I'd write a simple reflection, finish the assignment, and go onto the next one…<br>
It's kind of funny how my mentality going into the video was exactly the OPPOSITE of what Sherref would advise us to have, in kitchen vs. restaurant terms. So after checking myself, I thought how about cooking up some humble pie instead of ordering that italian, marlon !?<br>
<br>
My interpretation of the DevBootCamp humble pie recipe:
<br><br>
1-Blown Mind<br>
1-Open Heart<br>
1-Willing Body<br>
2-Cups of Childlike Innocence and zest for life<br>
1-Cup Mad Scientist<br>
1-Cup Creative Artist<br>
<br><br>
Stir with discipline and in an IKE bowl (Integrity, Kindness, Effort) 
<br>
Dish is best shared with others and with a cool glass of gratitude.
<br>
And just like any recipe, own it! ALL OF IT. Own the ingredients. Own the process. Own the taste. And excuse the mess…so do clean up after yo' self and put them dishes back in place for others to use. 
<br><br><br>
Also, here are a few nuggets of wisdom that I gleaned from the video:
<br><br>
-We all have a ton to learn, a ton to offer, and a ton to learn in offering.<br>
-If want to go fast, go alone. If you want to get far, go together. WE ARE GOING FAR AND FAST.<br>
-This is a transformational right of passage.<br>
-Be mindful of when to go wide and when to go deep.<br>
-Be disciplined with your time.  Time Block.<br> 
-Be open to keep getting your mind blown<br>
-Kick your own arssssssssse<br>
-THIS IS ONE BIG EXPERIMENT<br>
<br><br>
Soooo…what is cooking!?
<br><br>
Well, currently I'm in week 2 of 3 for unit 1, phase 0; and, although I'm looking forward to kicking my own ass, let me tell you, the program has kicked my ass enough without any of my help. 
<br><br>
Going into this program I thought it was going to be a walk in the park. It was just going to be a matter of allocating the appropriate time to get through the materials, manage my professional work on the side, and make adjustments as necessary. WRONG. VERY WRONG INDEED MARwrong. 
<br><br>
The first week gave me a taste of how challenging the materials can be (I do have NO programming experience) and how extraordinary the focus/effort needs to be to actually pull this thing off. I had left too much work for the end of the week and realized I was not going to finish. Honestly, I kind of freaked. How am I going to keep working on my business? Do I really want to even be a programer? What did I get myself into!?!? 
<br><br>
But you know what? I'm pretty glad I went through this early on, as it has completely renewed my vigor and has reaffirmed my commitment to this process. So I was wrong about the curriculum….the good kind of wrong. The kind of wrong that challenges you to let go of your assumptions and be completely vulnerable to what is simply there. The kind of wrong that opens up the space to be "Right" beyond your wildest dreams. 
<br><br>
And so now I kind of have an idea of what DevBootCamp is…but even that is probably wrong. But That is what I feel most Right about at present time.
<br>
I have no idea how this whole thing is going to play out; I have no idea how life is going to be like once I move to SF for the actual course work; I have no idea what is going to happen to the business I am building; AND I'm cool with that.
<br>
On the other hand, I am open to witnessing incredible transformations, being completely vulnerable, trusting the process, and going all in…
<br><br>
So let's make a beautiful mess. Bon appétit !
