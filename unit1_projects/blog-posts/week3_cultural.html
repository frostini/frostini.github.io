  	<h2> Training Thoughts</h2>
  	<h3> Thinking about time managent</h3>

  	<p> It's pretty nice to be able to sit down, as part of an assignment for DBC, and check in with myself to feel how my your journey is going so far, how my thinking may be a factor to to my success (or failure) with the program, evaluating strategies that can be useful in overcoming difficulties, and implementing an action plan to overcome these difficulties.</p>
	<p>I am writing this as of the third week of DevBootCamp; and, in retrospect, there have already been many breakthroughs AND breakdowns. As we continue to blaze through  the DBC work-warp, I'm also seeing how just about every breakdown also leads to breakthrough, if you just stay at it.</p>
	<p>There were times were I needed to GIT some fresh air because I was about to GIT a strokeâ€¦so much so that I ended up working remotely for most of the assignments in the beginning. It turned out that I had "git init" one too many repositories, which ended up provoking some pretty buggy behavior, along with a case of the DS.Store blues, and some files choosing to hide from being seen, added, or committed. But you know what, I can say I am no longer afraid of the command line and have actually begun to look forward to collaborating on larger projects through version control systems such as GIT.</p>
	<p>GIT wasn't even close to being the main perpetrator here though. Nope. It was me causing most of ma' woes; and, primarily in the form of limiting mental constructs.</p>
	<p>Here is the thought-loop that was most apparent and difficult to work with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I can't do everything.</li>
		<li>Sure you can, you're "Marlon".</li>
		<li>Add more to my plate.</li>
		<li>Now I have too much on my plate-STRESS</li>
		<li>Work like crazy</li>
		<li>Feel like I have room to breath</li>
		<li>Put more on my plate because I'm feeling optimistic</li>
		<li>Now I have too much on my plate, again-STRESS</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've feel as if I've identified two underlying causes reinforcing this loop:</p>

<p>-(REASON 1)My time estimation skills are HORRIBLE when it comes to projecting how long the assignment is going to take me and then consequently schedule the time to get it done. How can I estimate how long it is going to take me to accomplish something I have never done before?</p>

<p>-(REASON 2)I think I'm smarter, faster, more able than I truly am. Shucks. And therefore overcompensate by thinking I will accomplish things faster and understand things easier than I actually do.</p>

<p>Reason 1 + Reason 2 = TIMEBOMB</p>

<h5>Solution: Open Work Blocks</h5>

<p>I no longer try to estimate how long something is going to take and am trying to take my identity bias out of the equation entirely. How so?
I simply allocate a task to a pomodoro time block (25mins), enter it with an open mind, and just hammer away at it.  By actually working on the task, even if I can't finish it in that time block,  
 I garner a working understanding of the task at hand and am then better positioned to devise a follow-up work plan. Aside from being a more pragmatic approach than blind-guestimation, working with this structure allows me to be completely invested in the task during that time block. Plus, working in this way is proving very rewarding as I am becoming more productive AND enjoy the complete task submersion.</p>

<p>This also complements my thinking style, Abstract Sequential, as this approach helps to ground my "love of theory and abstract thought".</p>
