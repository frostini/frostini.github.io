Seeing <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014"> Shereef's Kitchen vs. Restaurant video</a> struck more than just a chord for me, it completely harmonized.<br>
I'm getting through the content a bit late, as I had requested an extension for the first week, and so I'm seeing the video after most of my classmates and after reading some of their reflections. With this being said, I went into the video assuming that I already knew what the video was going to be about, I'd write a simple reflection, finish the assignment, and go onto the next one…<br>
It's kind of funny how my mentality going into the video was exactly the OPPOSITE of what Sherref would advise us to have, in kitchen vs. restaurant terms. So after checking myself, I thought how about cooking up some humble pie instead of ordering that italian, marlon !?<br>
<br>
My interpretation of the DevBootCamp humble pie recipe:
<br><br>
1-Blown Mind<br>
1-Open Heart<br>
1-Willing Body<br>
2-Cups of Childlike Innocence and zest for life<br>
1-Cup Mad Scientist<br>
1-Cup Creative Artist<br>
<br><br>
Stir with discipline and in an IKE bowl (Integrity, Kindness, Effort) 
<br>
Dish is best shared with others and with a cool glass of gratitude.
<br>
And just like any recipe, own it! ALL OF IT. Own the ingredients. Own the process. Own the taste. And excuse the mess…so do clean up after yo' self and put them dishes back in place for others to use. 
<br><br><br>
Also, here are a few nuggets of wisdom that I gleaned from the video:
<br><br>
-We all have a ton to learn, a ton to offer, and a ton to learn in offering.<br>
-If want to go fast, go alone. If you want to get far, go together. WE ARE GOING FAR AND FAST.<br>
-This is a transformational right of passage.<br>
-Be mindful of when to go wide and when to go deep.<br>
-Be disciplined with your time.  Time Block.<br> 
-Be open to keep getting your mind blown<br>
-Kick your own arssssssssse<br>
-THIS IS ONE BIG EXPERIMENT<br>
<br>
So let's get cooking...Bon appetit !
