	<h2 id="wireframe-subheader">DropBox review</h2>
		<p class="wireframe-text">Essentially, the DropBox website has 6 sections and they are as follows:
		<br><br>
		(1) Main Page/Initial screen page
		<br>
		(2-5)  Information Sections
		<br>
		(6) Footer Section

	<h3 class="section-header">Purpose.</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">The website's main purpose is to empower its visitors with the content needed to inform their decision to sign-up for dropbox. I'd dare to say that this website is landing page-inspired, with added access to company content in the footer. 
		</p>

	<h3 class="section-header">Section 1-Component</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">The Main Page section can be further broken down 4 components.
		<br><br>
		a) Top component. This component does not contain a navigation  menu, it is simply a download link in the top right corner. <br>
		b) Image-Left. It is an animation between three components, a computer, a tablet, and a cell phone. An image appears on the screen of the laptop and the same image is then pushed out to the other two instruments. <br>
		c) Content-Right. This section has the company icon at the top, their value proposition is centered and immediately follows that vertically (Your stuff, anywhere), followed by the main action button (sign-up), and is then concluded by a Sign-in link immediately below that. <br>
		d) Bottom Link Section. This link is a local link that simply scrolls the page down to the following content section.
		</p>
	<h3 class="section-header">Section 1: Purpose</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">The purpose of this section is to give the visitor enough information about the product to try to get them to sign-up immediately. Upon landing on the site, one can "see" what dropbox does in the first 5 seconds, thanks to the short animation/valueprop/icon, and the user can also click on the conveniently located Sign-Up button.
		</p>
	<h3 class="section-header">Sections 2-5: Components</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">Each one of these sections is essentially the same and can be broken down into two components.
		<br><br>
		a) Picture. The picture illustrates what the content mentions<br>
		b) Content. The content is next to the image and is essentially a Title with a couple of sentences below it.<br>
		These section are, Wherever You Are, Share with Confidence, Safe and Secure, and Drop Box for business, with a corresponding link top the dropbox for business page.
		<br><br>  
		</p>
	<h3 class="section-header">Section 2-5: Purpose</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">The purpose of these sections are to address any objections that the potential client might have, in case they weren't immediately convinced to sign-up for dropbox after seeing the initial section and wanted to "learn more" about the product. The objections are essentially doubts or questions that the potential client might have and that may become sign-up deterrents as a result of going unanswered or unaddressed. 
		</p>
	<h3 class="section-header">Section 6: Components</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text">This section can be further broken down into two components, which are distributed vertically. <br><br>
		a) A Blue Sign up button and a white Download button of the same size.<br>
		b) Horizontally distributed links. 8 of them.
		</p>
	<h3 class="section-header">Section 6: Purpose</h3>
		<p class="wireframe-text"> The purpose of this section is to allow those that have scrolled the entire page to sign-up or download the product. Furthermore, in case the person visiting the information is looking for other information (aside from downloading or enrolling) or is already a client, the links below the buttons can be clicked on to take you to their respective pages. This is very useful because this information is kept out of view for those that don't want to see and is made accessible for those that are looking for it. 
		<br><br>
		All in all, I believe the dropbox design team did an extraordinary job of managing their screen real estate by including only that which is vital, carrying a tasteful aesthetic, and distributing their content ideally for conversion.
